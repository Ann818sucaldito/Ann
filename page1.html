<p><center><font color="MediumSeaGreen"> I am Ann Kathryn R. Sucaldito</p></center></font>
<p style="background-color:tomato;">My academic journey has equipped me with a strong foundation in office and video production, web design, animation, programming languages, database management, robotics,  artificial intelligence, and other critical areas of computer science.
I have a true passion for teaching. I have spent several years in the classroom (computer laboratory) both online and onsite, nurturing young minds and inspiring a love for computer science. I assist my students learning thru hands-on activities, group projects, critical thinking exercises and problem-solving activities. I empower students to become confident digital citizens prepared for the challenges of the modern world.
